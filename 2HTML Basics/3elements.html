/*
1. HTML Elements:
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:


<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
Examples of some HTML elements:


<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>


Start tag	Element content	        End tag
<h1>	    My First Heading	    </h1>       <h1 to h6>
<p>	        My first paragraph	    </p>
<br>	    none	                none


2. Nested Elements:
-> This means that elements inside elements.

3. Case sensitive:
-> html is not case sensitive, means that <P> is same as <p>

4. Empty Element:
-> <br> is a break line and an empth element
